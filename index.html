                <p>Lecanemab: Why a new Alzheimer's drug has drawn praise and some concern With the number of
                    Alzheimer’s
                    cases increasing, the medical community needs treatments for this disease now more than ever. One
                    experimental drug, lecanemab, has been hailed by some experts as the treatment we have all been
                    waiting
                    But just how much hope should we place in lecanemab? In this Special Feature, we ask Alzheimer’s
                    disease
                    experts to explain how exactly lecanemab works</p>

                <p>Dementia vaccines: What are they, and when could they become available? Vaccines are arguably one of
                    the
                    greatest inventions of medical science of all time. Now, researchers are looking to take vaccine
                    technology one step further to protect against neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. In this
                    Special
                    Feature, we asked experts about what is currently under development, how a dementia vaccine would
                    work,
                    and how quickly we may see one becoming available to the public</p>

                <p>Treating obesity with culinary medicine: Could it be a solution? Obesity is a risk factor for many
                    health conditions. Current treatments include calorie restriction, bariatric surgery, and
                    medications. But the number of people with obesity continues to increase. Many factors lead to
                    weight gain, including the increased availability of calorie-dense foods. Medical News Today looked
                    at whether culinary medicine might be an effective treatment for obesity, and investigated what
                    approaches might work on a population level.</p>

                <p> Supplements for heart health: Which ones are beneficial and which ones are not? Diet and nutrition
                    are important drivers of cardiovascular disease (CVDs) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The American Heart
                    Association recommends diets high in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals and low in saturated fat
                    and sodium to reduce CVD and T2D risk. Further research into micronutrients is crucial for
                    personalizing preventive strategies for CVDs and T2D. In a recent study, researchers reviewed 884
                    randomized controlled trials to assess the link between micronutrients and cardiometabolic risk.</p>

                    world’s population has an autoimmune disease — a condition where the body’s immune system mistakenly
                    attacks its own tissues and organs.Scientists recognize more than 100 different autoimmune diseases.
                    This list includes multiple sclerosis (MS), where the immune system attacks the myelin sheathTrusted

                <p>Low levels of vitamin D in the brain linked to increased dementia risk An estimated 6 million people
                    live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the United States.That number is set to grow to 13 million by
                    2050 due to the country’s aging population. Alzheimer’s disease is also the sixth leading cause of
                    death in the U.S.Every 65 seconds, someone develops AD, and 60% to 80% of people with dementia have
                    AD. Alzheimer’s affects memory, thinking, and, as a result, behavior as it progresses. While it is
                    most often a disease of people 65 and older, early onset of AD can strike people in their 40s and
                    50s.</p>
